# WhatToWear
The app will tell you what is best to wear based on the weather in your location. 
Using the API from https://openweathermap.org the application, based on the temperature, will tell the user what is best to wear. 
Geolocation, current weather and how it feels, wind speed and cloud data are also displayed.
